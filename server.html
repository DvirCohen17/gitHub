        <h2>How to Set Up the Server</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Setting up the CCE server is simple and straightforward. Just follow these steps to get your collaborative coding environment up and running in no time:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            1. <strong>Download and Extract:</strong> First, click the <strong><span style="color: #e06666;">"Download Server"</span></strong> button above to download the server zip file. Once the download is complete, extract the contents of the zip file to a location on your computer where you want to store the server files. This can be any folder of your choice, but make sure it's a location you can easily access.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. <strong>Run the Server:</strong> Inside the extracted folder, you will find a file named <strong><span style="color: #e06666;">server.exe</span></strong>. Simply double-click this file to run the server. A console window should appear, indicating that the server is up and running. You don't need to install anythingâ€”just run this executable file.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. <strong>Check Your IP Address:</strong> To allow others to connect to your server, you'll need to provide them with your IP address. To find it, open the Command Prompt (you can do this by searching for <strong><span style="color: #6d9eeb;">"cmd"</span></strong> in the Start menu). In the Command Prompt, type <strong><span style="color: #e06666;">ipconfig</span></strong> and press Enter. Look for the <strong><span style="color: #6d9eeb;">"IPv4 Address"</span></strong> under your active network connection. This is the IP address you'll share with your friends so they can join your server.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. <strong>Start Collaborating:</strong> Now that your server is running and you have your IP address, you're ready to start coding together with your friends! Simply share the IP address with them, and they'll be able to connect to your server using the CCE app.
        </p>
        <p>
            And that's it! You've successfully set up the CCE server and are now ready to enjoy seamless collaborative coding with your team.
        </p>
        <p>
